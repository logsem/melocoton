Set Default Proof Using "Type".

(* NamedProps implements [name ∷ P], which is equivalent to P but knows to
   name itself [name] when destructed. The syntax is intended to be analogous
   to in Gallina where you might write [forall (Hfoo: 3 < 4), ...] for a
   hypothesis that would be introduced as [Hfoo] using automatic names.

  To use this library, write your definitions with [name ∷ P] for each conjunct.
  Then, use [iNamed "H"] to destruct an invariant "H" into its conjuncts, using
  their specified names. [iNamed] also introduces existentials with the names
  for the Coq binders.

  The names in a named proposition are not actually names but full-blown Iris intro
  patterns. This means you can write [#H] to automatically introduce to the
  persistent context, [%H] to name a pure fact (using string_to_ident), or even
  something crazy like ["[<- H]"] to destruct the hypothesis and rewrite by the
  first conjunct.

  There are a several top-level tactics provided to work with named
  propositions:
  - [iNamed "H"] names a single hypothesis. This is the most common usage.
  - [iNamed 1] on a wand introduces and destructs the premise.
  - [iNamed] names any anonymous hypotheses (without destructing them).
  - [iNamedAccu] is like [iAccu] - it solves a goal which is an evar with the
    conjunction of all the hypotheses - but produces a conjunction of named
    hypotheses. This is especially useful when that evar ?Q shows up as a
    premise in a wand, [?Q -∗ ...], at which point you can do [iNamed 1] to
    restore the context, including all the names.
  - [iFrameNamed] is a work-in-progress tactic to frame a goal with named
    conjuncts with the hypotheses using the names. This is intended to be much
    faster than framing the entire persistent and spatial contexts.

  Note that this library provides general support for propositions and is not
  specific to definitions. You can use named hypotheses in Hoare logic
  preconditions (to make the first iIntros more stable), in the postcondition
  (to make it easier for the caller to re-introduce hypotheses), or in loop
  invariants (to serve both of these purposes). If they ever get in the way you
  can always [rewrite /named] to get rid of the names.
 *)

(* Named props are defined to be the underlying prop. We used to have this
sealed, but it turns out that this inconveniently required many forwarding
typeclass instances (for things like [IntoPure], [Persistent], and framing) and
we didn't run into any issues making it completely transparent.

For efficiency reasons, we don't have [(PROP:bi) (P:PROP)], since this requires
a coercion to the carrier of [PROP]. *)
