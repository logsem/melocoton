# Melocoton: a Coq model and separation logic for verified interoperability between OCaml and C

## Building

You need to have [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/) >= 2.0 installed.

The simplest option is to create a fresh *local* opam switch with everything
needed, by running the following commands:

```
opam switch create -y --repositories=default,iris-dev=git+https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/iris/opam.git . ocaml-base-compiler.4.14.1
eval $(opam env)
```

Then run:

```
make
make html # optional, builds an html rendering of the sources
```

### Troubleshooting

- When visiting the artifact from a new terminal session, one needs to call opam
 to re-setup the terminal environment. To do this, call `eval $(opam env)` from
 the root of the repository.

- If the `opam switch` invocation fails at some point, either remove the `_opam`
 directory and re-run the command (this will redo everything), or do `eval
 $(opam env)` and then `opam install -y .` (this will continue from where it
 failed).

## Browsing the development

An easy way to browse the development is to open [html/toc.html](html/toc.html)
in a web browser after running `make html`. The webpage contains an HTML
rendering of the Coq scripts of the development.

Alternatively, using an IDE with Coq support is recommended.

## Structure of the Coq development

The Coq development lives in the `theories/` directory.

### Languages λML and λC

- `ml_lang/`: a small OCaml-like language (λML in the paper).

- `c_interface/`: definition of C values, state and corresponding separation
  logic resources. All of the development (except for concrete examples) only
  depends on `c_interface`, not on the concrete semantics of `c_lang`.

- `c_lang/`: a small C-like language (λC in the paper). Uses types from
  `c_interface` for its values and state.

### Generic language interfaces

- `language/`: generic notion of language, with the usual relational operational
  semantics, plus external calls. Both λC and λML implement this interface.

- `mlanguage/`: a language interface similar to language but using
  multirelations for operational semantics with dual non-determinism. The
  linking and wrapper combinator instantiate this interface, and thus the final
  combined language also does.

- `lang_to_mlang/`: generic lifting of `language` semantics to `mlanguage`.

### Interoperability

- `linking/`: linking of programs; operates on `mlanguage`s
  + `linking/lang.v`: operational semantics of linking
  + `linking/weakestpre.v`: program logic and correctness of linking

- `interop/`: FFI semantics and program logic rules, as a `mlanguage`
  + `interop/basics.v`: definitions of the wrapper values, blocks, and various
    parts of its state
  + `interop/{state.v,lang.v}`: operational semantics of the wrapper
  + `interop/{basics_resources.v,gctoken.v}`: ghost state of the wrapper program logic
  + `interop/update_laws.v`: points-to update laws
  + `interop/prims_proto.v`: interfaces of the FFI primitives
  + `interop/wp_prims/*.v`: soundness proof of FFI primitives
  + `interop/wp_simulation.v`: toplevel soundness proof of the wrapper program logic
  + `interop/adequacy.v`: toplevel adequacy theorem for linked+wrapped programs

### Top-level rules

- `combined/`: definition of the combined language by composing linking and the
  wrapper; with a combined correctness theorem and adequacy proof relating to
  the operational semantics.

- `c_interop/`: Hoare triples for FFI primitives, instantiated on λC from their
  interfaces. Useful for verifying concrete examples.

### Cross-language concepts

- `language_commons.v`: definition of interfaces and operations on them
  (interfaces are called "protocols" in the development)

- `multirelations.v`: definition of multirelations for semantics with dual
  non-determinism

### Case studies

- `ml_lang/logrel`: logical relation for λML defining a semantic interpretation
  of λML types. Defined strictly on top of λML, but allows instantiating
  the semantic type of external calls with arbitrary Iris propositions.

- `examples/`: example programs leveraging the FFI

   + `snappy_max_compressed_length`: `buffy_max_len_code`
   + `snappy_compress`: `buffy_compress_code`.
- λML implementation of `is_compressible` (Fig 2): in `examples/compression/buffers_client.v`
  + `is_compressible`: `ML_client_code`.

Section 2.2:

- Definition of λC (Fig 3):
  + values and state are defined in `c_interface/defs.v` (`val` and `c_state`)
  + expressions and programs are defined in `c_lang/lang.v` (`expr`, `program`)

- Definition of λML (Fig 3):
  + values, expressions and state are defined in `ml_lang/lang.v` (`val`, `expr`, `state`)

- IrisC program logic rules (Fig 4):
  + `READ-C` is `wp_load` in `c_lang/primitive_laws.v`
  + `WRITE-C` is `wp_store` in `c_lang/primitive_laws.v`
  + `ALLOC-C` is `wp_Malloc_vec` in `c_lang/derived_laws.v`

  + `READ-ML` is `wp_loadN` in `ml_lang/primitive_laws.v`
  + `WRITE-ML` is `wp_storeN` in `ml_lang/primitive_laws.v`
  + `ALLOC-ML` is `wp_allocN` in `ml_lang/primitive_laws.v`

- `CALL-INTERNAL` (Fig 4) is `wp_call` in `language/weakestpre.v`
  (formulated as a rule on weakest preconditions instead of triples).
  It applies to both the WP of λML and λC.

- `CALL-EXTERNAL` (Fig 4) is `wp_extern'` in `language/weakestpre.v`
  (formulated as a rule on weakest preconditions instead of triples).
  It applies to both the WP of λML and λC.

- The triple for `snappy_max_compressed_length` and for `snappy_compress` is specified in
  `examples/compression/compression_specs.v`, the proofs are in

  Note that the interface shown in the paper is derived from a stronger specification of
  `buf_alloc`, shown in `examples/compression/buffers_specs.v`.

- Note: we currently only have binary pairs in the Coq formalization, whereas
  the paper use tuples with 3 elements for representing λML buffers. In the Coq
  formalization we have nested pairs instead.

    and mutability `m`
  + `γ ↦foreign a` is a custom block (custom blocks are called foreign blocks in
    the Coq development)

- The relation between runtime values and λC values (`v ~_C^θ w` in the paper)

  from the paper)
- `EmbedC` (Fig 8) is `combined_embed_c` in `combined/rules.v`

    called `listener_client_1_adequacy.v`

## Axioms

This development uses Transfinite Iris, which itself relies on the following
non-constructive axioms:

- Propositional Extensionnality (`Coq.Logic.PropExtensionality.propositional_extensionality`)
- Proof Irrelevance (`Coq.Logic.ProofIrrelevance.proof_irrelevance`)
- (Dependent) Functional extensionality (`Coq.Logic.FunctionalExtensionality.functional_extensionality_dep`)
- Excluded Middle (`Coq.Logic.Classical_Prop.classic`)

These axioms [can be safely added to
Coq](https://github.com/coq/coq/wiki/The-Logic-of-Coq#what-axioms-can-be-safely-added-to-coq).
